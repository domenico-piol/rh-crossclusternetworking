# Cross-Cluster networking Demo with OpenShift
The base for all following demos will be some multi-cluster setups in Red Hat's lab environment.
Check the respective section for details.

Also, you need an appropriate application. I use my own demo-application SCCStore, which is available here:

https://github.com/domenico-piol/SCCstore

By default, the demo-application is a multi-tier app running in the same namespace. For this demo, we will separate the database from the rest of the application into the second cluster.

This said - as a first step - clone the SCCStore application repository.

    git clone https://github.com/domenico-piol/SCCstore.git

This said, create a namespace **in each of the workload-clusters**:

    oc new-project sccstore-dev

The application can now be deployed to ech of the namespaces in both clusters. We use kustomize for this, so in the SCCstore folder, run:

    oc apply -k kustomize/overlays/dev

For simplicity's sake, we will not modify the existing SCCStore application. The required modifications will be described in the respective sections.

## Submariner
Submariner interconnects Kubernetes clusters through a single, unified network (Layer 3). 
Combined with service-discovery, this enables correct routing to the applicationâ€™s service implementation no matter which cluster it resides in. 

Submariner has - in principle - no knowledge about the application. I creates a VPN-tunnel between the clusters.
Automatic service discovery is available, but one can restrict what can be consumed from other clusters - or more precisely, you must publish the available services.

It's simple, coarse-grained cluster to cluster communication. Beside exporting services, applications have very little additional effort.

> :warning: **Note**
> And this is one of the limitations... Submariner supports only k8s-to-k8s cluster communication! 

See Instructions for the demo [here](submariner/README.md)

## Red Hat Service Interconnect (Skupper)
Red Hat Service Interconnect - or Skupper - solves the problem of enabling communication (on Layer 7) and service discovery between different types of application environments. Between Kubernetes clusters and/or other types of application environments, such as virtual machines and bare-metal servers.

Other than e.g. Submariner, Skupper is a high-performance lightweight AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) message router. So it uses a messaging system instead of VPN tunneling. 
Hmmm... you remember the declared obsolete ESB (Enterprise Service Bus)?
